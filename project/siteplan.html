        <li><strong>Site Name</strong>: BOGT-PSL Security Monthly News.</li>
        <p>I chose this site name because the purpose of the site is to bring monthly news about the BOGT-PSL Security. This will help the public to know what the happenings in the security department. It will also give an opportunity for feedback from the public.</p>
        <li><strong>Site Purpose</strong>: The news will be about the security trainings for the month. The incidents that took place for the month. E.g If there was a thief caught within the month, if there was accidental or non accidental deaths within the month. It will also include improvements the team have made within the month.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenerios</strong>: (1) Can the team give trainings to other security outfit? Obviously, the answer is no. The security is mainly for the security of live and property of the company. (2) Can the give do other security work outside the company? Obviously, the answer is no as the company mandates that the team on shift should have enough rest to avoid fatigue. anything that will add to the man hour work load is not acceptable. </li>
        <li><strong>Color Schema</strong>: I will make use of four colors which are grey, blue, red, and white. The blue will be used at the header and footer. The grey will be the background color. The red will be at the logo and other areas. The white color will be used at the  navigation and footer text colors</li>
        <li><strong>Typography</strong>: I will use two font families which are roboto san serif and arial san serif. The roboto san serif will be use in the header and footer which the arial will be used in the body.</li>
