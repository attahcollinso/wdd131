                <h3>1. SAFETY OF PERSONNEL:</h3>
                <br>
                
                <p>There was no record of accidental or non accidental death nor injury to any personnel during the month of September 2024. Even though there was little complains of health challenges, every personnel went about his duties throughout the month of September. The safety trainings both at SPDC and PSL levels played a vital role also as all personnel adhere to safety precautions.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>2. 24/7 SUIVELLANCE:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>There was round the clock Suivellance and logging of patrols throughtout the month of September 2024. The Security Team were on patrol both day and night thereby scaring away unscrupulous elements that may have intentions to steal or vandalize SPDC assets. Under the sun or in the rain, we were dedicated and selfless in the discharge of our duties.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>3. SECURITY TRAININGS</h3>
                <br>
                <p>There were many Security trainings throughout the month of September 2024. These were made possible by our able Project Security Supervisor, Mr. Awala Michael. He unwaveringly gave the personnel trainings on weekly bases. This was a boost to the morals of the personnel. Kudos sir.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>4. ENHANCEMENT OF PATROL</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The cover area was pertitioned into zones. Personnel were stationed at every zone thereby enhancing the patrol and Suivellance level. Security presence was felt round the clock. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>5. MORE SUIVELLANCE EQUIPMENT</h3>
                <br>
                <p>More Suivellance Equipment were made available to the team. This helped the work to be more robust during the month of September 2024. There were no communition breach because we had effective communition gadgets.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>6. MORE COLLABORATION WITH THE SPY POLICE, PSS, AND DSS</h3>
                <br>
                <p>There were close colaborations with the Spy Police. They gave the personnel adequate assistance and encouragement during the month of September 2024. The PSS were very close to the personnel, encouraging, training, and supporting the very best way they could during the month of September 2024. The DSS also were interfacing at every point in time with the team throughout the month of September 2024. </p>
